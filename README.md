# Skycoin C library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skycoin/libskycoin.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/skycoin/libskycoin)

Skycoin C library (a.k.a `libskycoin`) exports the Skycoin API to DApps using the C programming language.
It is also the foundation to build client libraries for other programming languages.

## Subprojects

The Skycoin C library is made of the following components

- `lib/cgo`     : C wrappers for the Skycoin core API
- `lib/swagger` : Swagger specifications for generating REST API clients
- `lib/swig`    : SWIG interfaces to generate wrappers around the Skycoin core API for other programming languages

Consult respective `README` files for further details.

## Development

We have two branches: `master` and `develop`.

- `develop` is the default branch and will always have the latest code.
  The submodule at `gopath/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin` has to be
  in sync with `skycoin/skycoin` `develop` branch.
- `master` will always be equal to the current stable release on the website, and should correspond with the latest release tag.
  The submodule at `gopath/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin` has to be
  in sync with `skycoin/skycoin` `master` branch.

Separate stable development branches will be created to work on releases for supporting the
most recent stable version of Skycoin. The name of these branches should be the Skycoin
major and minor version numbers followed by `dev` suffix e.g. `0.25dev`.
These branches may be forked out of either `master` or `develop` branches, and 
the submodule at `gopath/src/github.com/skycoin/skycoin` has to be
in sync with the corresponding tag of `skycoin/skycoin` official repository.

Stable development branches are created most of the time for the following reasons:

- A Skycoin release increasing [patch version number](https://semver.org/).
- Enhanced support and bug fixes for a version of PySkycoin compiled against an
  stable version of Skycoin
- Backporting useful features added in `develop`.

### General development guidelines

The following rules are enforced

- Contributions must comply to the development guidelines documented in the [Skycoin wiki](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/wiki).
- C / C++ code must comply to the [Bitcoin C coding style](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c) (enforced by `clang-format`).
